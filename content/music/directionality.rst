Directionality is an abstract concept. It essentially means making a musical idea (a motive, a phrase, or even larger structures) sound as though it is *going somewhere*. It implies some kind of connection between the notes that constitute that musical idea: when an interpreter plays a group of three notes with directionality, they shouldn't sound like they're playing one note, then another one, then another one - the effect should be radically different from what we would obtain if each note was played in isolation and recorded and then the three recordings were strung together; rather, the player should make them sound in a way they could never sound if they weren't meant to sound together in that sequence. Directionality implies a choice - that of the movement that the interpreter is willing to convey. For example, if we remain in the three-note situation: the first and second notes could be leading to the third one; or the first note leads and the other two follow as a consequence of it; or the second and third sound like they're moving away from the first one. Or the first leads into the second and the third moves away from it. Or the first leads to the third but the second somehow interrupts the motion.

These connections don't imply that the notes must be glued together forming a legato. Staccato notes can (and should) be directed from one another.

So much is involved in realizing this directionality. At a first glance it could seem as just a matter of micro dynamics
